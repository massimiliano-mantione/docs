# Description #

Replace documents in a table. Accepts a JSON document or a ReQL expression,
and replaces the original document with the new one. The new document must
have the same primary key as the original document.

The `replace` command can be used to both insert and delete documents. If
the "replaced" document has a primary key that doesn't exist in the table,
the document will be inserted; if an existing document is replaced with
`null`, the document will be deleted. Since `update` and `replace` operations
are performed atomically, this allows atomic inserts and deletes as well.

You can pass the following options using [optArg](/api/java/optarg/):

- `durability`: possible values are `hard` and `soft`. This option will override
  the table or query's durability setting (set in [run](/api/java/run/)).
  In soft durability mode RethinkDB will acknowledge the write immediately after
  receiving it, but before the write has been committed to disk.
- `return_changes`:
    - `true`: return a `changes` array consisting of `old_val`/`new_val` objects
      describing the changes made, only including the documents actually
      updated.
    - `false`: do not return a `changes` array (the default).
    - `"always"`: behave as `true`, but include all documents the command tried
      to update whether or not the update was successful. (This was the behavior
      of `true` pre-2.0.)
- `non_atomic`: if set to `true`, executes the replacement and distributes the
  result to replicas in a non-atomic fashion. This flag is required to perform
  non-deterministic updates, such as those that require reading data from
  another table.

Replace returns an object that contains the following attributes:

- `replaced`: the number of documents that were replaced.
- `unchanged`: the number of documents that would have been modified, except
  that the new value was the same as the old value.
- `inserted`: the number of new documents added. A document is considered inserted if its primary key did not exist in the table at the time of the `replace` operation.
- `deleted`: the number of deleted documents when doing a replace with `null`.
- `errors`: the number of errors encountered while performing the replace.
- `first_error`: If errors were encountered, contains the text of the first
  error.
- `skipped`: 0 for a replace operation.
- `changes`: if `returnChanges` is set to `true`, this will be an array of
  objects, one for each objected affected by the `replace` operation. Each
  object will have two keys: `{new_val: <new value>, old_val: <old value>}`.

__Example:__ Replace the document with the primary key `1`.

```java
r.table("posts").get(1).replace(
    r.hashMap("id", 1).with("title", "Lorem ipsum")
     .with("content", "Aleas jacta est")
     .with("status", "draft")
).run(conn);
```

__Example:__ Remove the field `status` from all posts.

```java
r.table("posts").replace(post -> post.without("status")).run(conn);
```

__Example:__ Remove all the fields that are not `id`, `title` or `content`.

```java
r.table("posts").replace(
    post -> post.pluck("id", "title", "content")
).run(conn);
```

__Example:__ Replace the document with the primary key `1` using soft durability.

```java
r.table("posts").get(1).replace(
    r.hashMap("id", 1)
     .with("title", "Lorem ipsum")
     .with("content", "Aleas jacta est")
     .with("status", "draft")
).optArg("durability", "soft").run(conn);
```

__Example:__ Replace the document with the primary key `1` and return the values of the document before
and after the replace operation.

```java
r.table("posts").get(1).replace({
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Lorem ipsum",
    "content": "Aleas jacta est",
    "status": "published"
}, return_changes=True).run(conn)
```

The result will have a `changes` field:

```json
{
    "deleted": 0,
    "errors":  0,
    "inserted": 0,
    "changes": [
        {
            "new_val": {
                "id":1,
                "title": "Lorem ipsum"
                "content": "Aleas jacta est",
                "status": "published",
            },
            "old_val": {
                "id":1,
                "title": "Lorem ipsum"
                "content": "TODO",
                "status": "draft",
                "author": "William",
            }
        }
    ],   
    "replaced": 1,
    "skipped": 0,
    "unchanged": 0
}
```
